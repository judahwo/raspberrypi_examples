    "This program demonstrates the use of internal pull-up resistors with the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins. The program reads the state of an input pin and sets the state of an output pin accordingly. The input pin is connected to a push button with one end connected to the pin and the other end connected to ground. The output pin is connected to an LED with one end connected to the pin and the other end connected to a 330 Ohm resistor which is then connected to ground. The program reads the state of the input pin and sets the state of the output pin accordingly. When the button is pressed, the input pin is connected to ground and the output pin is set to high (1) and the LED glows. When the button is not pressed, the input pin is connected to 3.3V and the output pin is set to low (0) and the LED does not glow.\n",
