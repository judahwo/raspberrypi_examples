    "The **`myDim.py`** script is tailored for a Raspberry Pi system to control an LED's brightness using PWM (Pulse Width Modulation). Two buttons, connected to GPIO pins 40 and 38, are used for dimming and brightening the LED. The script continuously monitors the state of these buttons in an infinite loop and changes the duty cycle of the PWM signal accordingly. The PWM signal, in turn, controls the brightness of an LED connected to GPIO pin 37. The script also includes error handling for keyboard interrupts to safely stop PWM and clean up GPIO settings.\n",
