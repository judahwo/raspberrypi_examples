    "# **`myBlink.ipynb`**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **`myBlink.ipynb`** code is structured to run on a Raspberry Pi and aims to read a digital input from one GPIO pin and control a digital output on another GPIO pin based on the input state. Specifically, it reads the state of pin 40 and sets the state of pin 38 accordingly. The program runs in an infinite loop, repeatedly reading the input and updating the output. The loop halts when a KeyboardInterrupt occurs, upon which it cleans up the GPIO settings.\n",
