    "The **`GPIOInput.py`** code is intended for a Raspberry Pi and is designed to read the digital state of a GPIO pin every second. It utilizes the Raspberry Pi GPIO library for interfacing with the board's GPIO pins. The code sets up a specific pin (pin 40 in this case) as an input and goes into an infinite loop, continually reading and printing the state of this pin. The loop is interrupted by a KeyboardInterrupt, at which point the GPIO settings are returned to their default state.\n",
