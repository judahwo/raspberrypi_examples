    "This program toggles an LED on and off when a button is pressed. The program uses the Raspberry Pi GPIO library to read the state of the button and to set the state of the LED. The program uses the sleep function from the time library to pause for a short time between reading the button state and updating the LED state. The program uses a while loop to continuously read the button state and update the LED state. The program uses a try/except block to handle a keyboard interrupt. The program uses the cleanup function from the GPIO library to reset all GPIO pins and clean up resources. The program prints a message to the console when the GPIO pins have been cleaned up. \n",
