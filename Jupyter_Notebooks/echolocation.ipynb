    "# **`echolocation.py`**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **`echolocation.py`** code interfaces with an ultrasonic sensor using the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins. The code issues an ultrasonic pulse through the sensor's trigger pin and measures the time it takes for the echo pulse to return. The pulse's round-trip time is then printed in microseconds. The script runs in an infinite loop and prints the measured time until manually interrupted by the user, at which point the GPIO pins are cleaned up.\n",
