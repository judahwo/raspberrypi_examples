    "This program uses three buttons to control the brightness of three LEDs. The buttons are connected to the GPIO pins of the Raspberry Pi and the LEDs are connected to the PWM pins. The program uses the `RPi.GPIO` library to control the GPIO pins and the `time` library to add a delay between each iteration of the main loop. The program uses a try-except block to catch a `KeyboardInterrupt` and perform cleanup before exiting the program. The program uses a `while` loop to continuously monitor the state of the buttons and update the duty cycle of the PWM channels accordingly. The program uses a `for` loop to iterate through the three channels and update the duty cycle of each channel. The program uses a `if` statement to check for button press events and update the corresponding duty cycle. The program uses a `print` statement to print a message indicating successful cleanup. \n",
